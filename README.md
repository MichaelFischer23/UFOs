## UFOs
#### Overview of the Project
This project was created using javascript and html in order to create a webpage that displays information about ufo sightings. The initial website was created with only the ability to filter the date of the sighting but it was updated in to include a filter for every column in the table. 

#### Results
The new website works similarly to the old one. When it opens you see 5 different areas to enter your search criteria for the columns of date, city, state, country, and shape.

When trying to filter the table to get information needed all you have to do is insert what you are looking for into the bar that matches the column you are looking for. Mulitple filter criteria can be entered into the query. You can look for both state and shape. When running the filter the console will display the number of items returned.

#### Summary
The website functions and returns search criteria but could be updated in a few ways to make it more accessible. Having 5 different filter bars does make the page look more cluttered than it needs to be. Creating a single filter bar that would be able to filter all of the columns would make the design look more sleek. Another additional development that could be made to the website is be able to have multiple criteria of the same category return, for example you could look for data from both Ohio and California. This would help the user compare data without having to open two different parts of the page.
